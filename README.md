# Lib2to3
A Dirty copy of the python2 to python3 code converter

## Why Copy this if it was dropped in 3.10?
- There's still a few use-cases such as some things I've found recently.
  - A good example was the duktape C Library which still needed fixing up.
  - Archived scripts (if you wanted to simulate these, for example: old legendary saphyra script)
